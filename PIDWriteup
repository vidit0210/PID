Effects of PID 


-Started with setting all the values one and later learning by hit and trial or we can say ReinforceMent Learning :P

-Ki was an essential part of The PID Control System for the stabalize purpose.
set the value to 0.0001 got descent accelearation but there were strong loss of inertia during turning .It Can observed on Simulator it was getting jerks while taking the turns

-Kp value was decreased for reverse steering and set it value to 0.1

-Made No Changes to the Kd because as what it starts for: the difference between the current and the previous one, which backslashed the affect of Kp. Hence, I set it as default, which is 1.0
